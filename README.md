# DCS-CTF-Writeups
Compilation of writeups from members of the Dartmouth Cybersecurity Society.

## Formatting
1. Each CTF challenge category has its own folder.
2. Each problem should be represented as a folder, and should be named in the following format: **CTFName-ChallengeName** 
3. Each problem folder will contain the following: a README.md, solution.md, and any other files required to complete the challenge.
4. The README.md will contain information regarding the original challenge description, and the person writing the write-up. Check *Template-README.md* for specifics.
5. The solution.md will contain the actual write-up, how the flag was found. Use screenshots/code snippets: whatever works!
