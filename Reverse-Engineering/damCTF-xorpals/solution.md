# xorpals

**Solution**: 

We can just brute force the solution to this problem because there are only 256 possible characters to xor each string with.

I wrote a Python program that reads in all the strings in the text file and xors then with all possible characters.  We print the xor'd string if it starts with the same characters as the flag.
